<p>Hi. We noticed there's a gap in audio recording software solutions. You have two options: a simple recorder or a full digital audio workstation (DAW). One is very limited and the other too complicated and time consuming to learn.</p>
<p>That's why we are creating a recording application with features specifically curated for audiobook narrators, including punch and roll recording, non-destructive editing, and concepts like "books" instead of generic projects.</p>
<p>We are still in ideation phase, and you have an oppurtunity to impact how the very first version of this software will look and behave like.
</p>
<p>If you would like to be informed about our progress or want to give us feedback, feel free to leave us your e-mail address or write us at <a href="mailto:info@ambeep.com">{{ site.email }}</a>.</p>
