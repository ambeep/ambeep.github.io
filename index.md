Hi. We noticed there's a gap in audio recording software solutions. You have two options: a simple recorder or a full digital audio workstation (DAW). One is very limited abd the other too complicated and time consuming to learn.
<br>
That's why we are creating a recording application with features specifically curated for audiobook narrators, including punch and roll recording, non-destructive editing, and concepts like "books" instead of generic projects.
<br>
We are still in ideation phase, and you have an oppurtunity to impact how the very first version of this software will look and behave like.

If you would like to be informed about our progress or want to give us feedback, feel free to leave us your e-mail address or write us at <a href="mailto:info@ambeep.com">{{ site.email }}</a>.
